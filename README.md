## Description
This application was created to enhance the efficiacy of users in that they can generate a README easily and quickly within their code, rather than completing their application and creating a README after and inputting lots of information. It can be extremely useful for web developers who are creating multiple projects a day. Creating a readMe within the application code can benefit many.
